# street-grades
Find out how steep any street in the world is. This is a tool designed for cyclists and runners, to help you pick the hilliest (or flattest) routes. It works by joining OSM road networks with elevation data, and using the (distance / elevation difference) to calculate grades.

# setup
Mac setup:
- brew install gdal
- mkvirtualenv # Or setup your own venv
- pip install -r requirements.txt

# get yer data
You'll need elevation data, and street map data to run. Luckily the osmnet python module handles all of the OSM work - we specify a bounding box, and it downloads all of the OSM road network within that box. But you have to do extra work to obtain the elevation dataset.

There are a few elevation datasets out there. Thanks to the US Government for creating and providing them. In general, you should prefer "1m" data over "30m" data; and "30m" data over "90m" data. The average city block (in San Francisco) is around 150m. When your elevation data is accurate to 30m, and elevation changes rapidly, that results in some inaccurate readings.

The USGS datasets also seem to recognize building height as elevation. Downtown San Francisco is full of incorrectly labeled steep streets.

- 30m blah blah from usgs.gov
- 1m blah blah from DEM

Your downloaded data should be in hgt or tif format. Put it in data/ dir under this path. The scripts below will, by default, look in data/ for downloaded elevation raster data.

# run
- python street_grades/find_intersections.py \<region name\>
Ex: % python street-grades/find_intersections.py kirkland
-- Outputs cached street data in /tmp/\<region name\>
    -- Outputs street intersections to /tmp/\<region name\>/intersections_with_coordinates.csv
    -- The output csv has a row per "block", with the endpoint coordinates of each intersection at the ends of that "block".

- python street_grades/grades --edges_csv \<street intersections data\>
Ex: % python street-grades/grades.py --edges_csv /tmp/kirkland/edges_with_coordinates.csv
    -- Outputs /tmp/e3.csv with a row per "block", the endpoint coordinates of that block; and the elevations at each end of the block, and the grade of the street.

# visualize
- Take your browser to kepler.gl
- Drag the csv grades file generated by `grades` in as a data source.
- Try setting "grade" as a tooltip
- Or coloring edges by "grade"
- Or coloring edges by "grade_category"
